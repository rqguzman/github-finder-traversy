# GITHUB FINDER
<p>
    This is an educational project provided by Brad Traversy, from </br>
    Traversy Media(https://www.traversymedia.com/) </br>
    
    This app searches for Github profiles informed by user.
</p>
<p>
    This project is part of Udemy's "React Front To Back" course and it will be developed in successive iterations, each one adding more aspects and fundamentals of React, progressively. 
</p>
<p>
    I have decided to implement this project to help me fixate React core concepts.
    It's an app to find a Github user by providing Github's username.
    During the app development we went from class-based components to functional components, the use of React Hooks and Context API.
